# tinyhexgame

Tiny game made in Godot. Hand-crafted hexagonal environment which slowly collapses. Crates which may be destroyed to loot weapons and resources. Stealth and low time-to-kill.

Fully rigged and animated mercenary with IK hands.

Soft-scifi aesthetic. Must protect oceanic drill from incoming enemies. Lose condition is when either you or the drill are destroyed. This, alongside the constant need to search for crates, prevents camping.
