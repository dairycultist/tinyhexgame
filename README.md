# tinyhexgame

Tiny, deceptively hard game made in Godot.

- Hand-crafted hexagonal environment which slowly collapses.
- Crates which may be destroyed to loot weapons and resources. Stealth and low time-to-kill.
- Fully rigged and animated mercenary with IK hands.
- Soft-scifi aesthetic. Must protect oceanic drill from incoming enemies. Lose condition is when either you or the drill are destroyed. This, alongside the constant need to search for crates, prevents camping.

11:53 has a snowy vibe. maybe instead of set in the ocean, it's set in a tundra? dark grey sky, soft snow, muffled sounds, shoot or die
